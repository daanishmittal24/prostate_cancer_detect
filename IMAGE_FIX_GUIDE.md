# Image Corruption Fix Guide

## 🚨 **Issue Identified:**
```
PIL.UnidentifiedImageError: cannot identify image file '/home/Saif/Pratham/ELC/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment/train_images/376a5058f8fcf38a3df4a0c431e974fa.tiff'
```

This means some TIFF files in your dataset are corrupted or in an unsupported format.

## 🔧 **Solutions (Choose One):**

### **Option 1: Quick Fix - Use Robust Training (Recommended)**
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x check_images.sh start_training_robust.sh

# Check what images are corrupted
./check_images.sh

# Start training with error handling (skips corrupted images)
./start_training_robust.sh
```

### **Option 2: Clean Dataset First**
```bash
# Make scripts executable  
chmod +x fix_dataset.sh

# Clean the dataset (removes corrupted images)
./fix_dataset.sh

# Then start normal training
./start_training.sh
```

### **Option 3: Manual Fix (If you want to see what's wrong)**
```bash
# Check the specific problematic file
file /home/Saif/Pratham/ELC/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment/train_images/376a5058f8fcf38a3df4a0c431e974fa.tiff

# Check file size
ls -lh /home/Saif/Pratham/ELC/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment/train_images/376a5058f8fcf38a3df4a0c431e974fa.tiff

# Try to identify the issue
python -c "
from PIL import Image
try:
    img = Image.open('/home/Saif/Pratham/ELC/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment/train_images/376a5058f8fcf38a3df4a0c431e974fa.tiff')
    print('Image loaded successfully')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Error: {e}')
"
```

## 📊 **What Each Solution Does:**

### **Robust Training:**
- ✅ Automatically skips corrupted images
- ✅ Uses fallback methods (OpenCV) if PIL fails  
- ✅ Creates dummy images for completely corrupted files
- ✅ Continues training without interruption
- ⚠️ May use slightly fewer training samples

### **Dataset Cleaning:**
- ✅ Removes all corrupted images permanently
- ✅ Creates a clean CSV file (`train_clean.csv`)
- ✅ Backs up original files
- ✅ Provides detailed corruption report
- ⚠️ Takes time to scan all images

## 🚀 **Recommended Quick Start:**

```bash
# 1. Check what's corrupted
chmod +x check_images.sh start_training_robust.sh
./check_images.sh

# 2. Start robust training (handles corruption automatically)
./start_training_robust.sh

# 3. Monitor training
./monitor.sh
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

The robust training will:
1. **Skip corrupted images** automatically
2. **Log warnings** for problematic files
3. **Continue training** with good images
4. **Show progress** normally in logs

You should see messages like:
```
WARNING: Image file too small: /path/to/corrupted.tiff
WARNING: Creating dummy image for corrupted file: /path/to/bad.tiff
```

But training will continue successfully!

## 📈 **After Training Starts:**

Monitor with:
```bash
# Check if training is running
./monitor.sh

# View live logs
tail -f outputs_robust_*/training_*.log

# Check GPU usage
nvidia-smi
```

The robust approach is recommended because it's fastest and handles the corruption gracefully without losing the entire dataset.
